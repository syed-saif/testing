# testing
so this is my first time working with git and using the command line fucntions
sorry if this is cringy(lol)

So the commit after the initial commit, was indeed done by me but the global variables were set as 'Syed Moinudeen',my brother, for the author of the commit.
well, so this is to check if the global variables really changed this time or not...

(dont read this, this is for webhook testing)
